# City Tech Library Website

# Project Description
This project is a repository for the Ursula C. Schwerin Library of the New York City College of Technology (City Tech), CUNY. 
The site was coded using Jekyll and Liquid, and utilizes YAML files to create the site's navigation, content, and breadcrumbs. Bootstrap 5.3 is the web framework used due to it's mobile forward design. 

It was coded by Abubakar R. Tidal, Jr. (Junior), Web Services & Multimedia Librarian, Professor, during the spring and summer terms of 2024. 

# Project Requirements and Dependencies
This project requires the requirements of Jekyll as well as some PHP to run some code here and there.

# How to Set up and Run the Project
Fork and install onto your system. Use 'jekyll build' on Linux-based systems to create the site in the _sites folder and copy the files onto your favorite web server. 

Update the _config.yml file to add your domain.

# How to make use of the Project

**Note**
The orientation directory is a WIP.
