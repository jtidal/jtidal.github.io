	<p><strong>Appendix I
	The City University of New York
	Policy on Acceptable Use of Computer Resources</strong></p>
	
	<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
	CUNY&rsquo;s computer resources are dedicated to the support of the university&rsquo;s mission of education, research and public service. In furtherance of this mission, CUNY respects,upholds and endeavors to safeguard the principles of academic freedom, freedom ofexpression and freedom of inquiry.
	
	CUNY recognizes that there is a concern among the university community that because
	information created, used, transmitted or stored in electronic form is by its nature
	susceptible to disclosure, invasion, loss, and similar risks, electronic communications and transactions will be particularly vulnerable to infringements of academic freedom.
	CUNY&rsquo;s commitment to the principles of academic freedom and freedom of 
  expression includes electronic information. Therefore, whenever possible, CUNY will resolve doubts about the need to access CUNY computer resources in favor of a user&#39;s privacy interest.
	
  However, the use of CUNY computer resources, including for electronic transactions 
  and communications, like the use of other university-provided resources and activities, 
  is subject to the requirements of legal and ethical behavior. This policy is intended to
  support the free exchange of ideas among members of the CUNY community 
  and between the CUNY community and other communities, while recognizing the responsibilities and limitations associated 
 </p> 
 <p> 
  <strong>Applicability</strong><br>
  This policy applies to all users of CUNY computer resources, 
  whether affiliated with
  CUNY or not, and whether accessing those 
  resources on a CUNY campus or remotely. This policy supersedes the 
  CUNY policy titled &ldquo;CUNY Computer User
  Responsibilities&rdquo; and any 
  college policies that are 
  inconsistent with this policy.</p>
<p>
	
	<strong>Definitions</strong><br>
	&ldquo;CUNY Computer resources&rdquo; refers to all computer and information 
  technology
	hardware, software, data, access and other resources 
  owned, operated, 
or contracted by CUNY. This includes, but is not 
limited to, personal 
	workstations, mainframes, minicomputers,
servers, network facilities, 
databases, memory, and associated 
peripherals and software, and the 
applications they support, 
such as email and access to the internet.
	&ldquo;E-mail&rdquo; includes point-to-point messages, postings to newsgroups and 
  listservs, and
	other electronic messages involving computers and 
  computer networks.</p>
	<p><strong>Rules for Use of CUNY Computer Resources</strong><br>
	1. Authorization. Users may not access a CUNY computer resource without
	authorization or use it for purposes beyond the scope of authorization. This
	includes attempting to circumvent CUNY computer resource system protection
	facilities by hacking, cracking or similar activities, accessing or using another
	person&rsquo;s computer account, and allowing another person to access or use the
	user&rsquo;s account. This provision shall not prevent a user from authorizing a
	colleague or clerical assistant to access information under the user&rsquo;s account on the
	user&rsquo;s behalf while away from a CUNY campus or because of a disability. CUNY
	computer resources may not be used to gain unauthorized access to another
	computer system within or outside of CUNY. Users are responsible for all
	actions performed from their computer account that they permitted or failed to
	prevent by taking ordinary security precautions.
<br>	
	2. Purpose. Use of CUNY computer resources is limited to activities relating to the
	performance by CUNY employees of their duties and responsibilities. For
	example, use of CUNY computer resources for private commercial or not-forprofit
	business purposes, for private advertising of products or services, or for
	any activity meant solely to foster personal gain, is prohibited. Similarly, use of
	CUNY computer resources for partisan political activity is also prohibited.
	Except with respect to CUNY employees other than faculty, where a supervisor
	has prohibited it in writing, incidental personal use of computer resources is
	permitted so long as such use does not interfere with CUNY operations, does not
	compromise the functioning of CUNY computer resources, does not interfere with
	the user&rsquo;s employment or other obligations to CUNY, and is otherwise in
	compliance with this policy.
	
	<br>3. Compliance with Law. CUNY computer resources may not be used for any
	purpose or in any manner that violates CUNY rules, regulations or policies, or
	federal, state or local law. Users who engage in electronic communications with
	persons in other states or countries or on other systems or networks may also be
	subject to the laws of those other states and countries, and the rules and policies
	of those other systems and networks. Users are responsible for ascertaining,
	understanding, and complying with the laws, rules, policies, contracts, and
	licenses applicable to their particular use.
	
	Examples of applicable federal and state laws include the laws of libel, obscenity
	and child pornography, as well as the following:
	Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
	Electronic Communications Privacy Act
	Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
	New York State Freedom of Information Law
	New York State Law with respect to the confidentiality of library records
	Examples of applicable CUNY rules and policies include the following:
	Sexual Harassment Policy
	Policy on Maintenance of Public Order
	Web Site Privacy Policy
	Gramm-Leach-Bliley Information Security Program
	University Policy on Academic Integrity
	Information Security policies
	
	<br>4. Licenses and Intellectual Property. Users of CUNY computer resources may
	use only legally obtained, licensed data or software and must comply with
	applicable licenses or other contracts, as well as copyright, trademark and other
	intellectual property laws.
	
	Much of what appears on the internet and/or is distributed via electronic
	communication is protected by copyright law, regardless of whether the copyright
	is expressly noted. Users of CUNY computer resources should generally assume
	that material is copyrighted unless they know otherwise, and not copy, download
	or distribute copyrighted material without permission unless the use does not
	exceed fair use as defined by the federal Copyright Act of 1976. Protected
	material may include, among other things, text, photographs, audio, video, graphic
	illustrations, and computer software.
	
	<br>5. False Identity and Harassment. Users of CUNY computer resources may not
	employ a false identity, mask the identity of an account or computer, or use
	computer resources to engage in abuse of others, such as sending harassing,
	obscene, threatening, abusive, deceptive, or anonymous messages within or
	outside CUNY.
	
	<br>6. Confidentiality. Users of CUNY computer resources may not invade the
	privacy of others by, among other things, viewing, copying, modifying or
	destroying data or programs belonging to or containing personal or confidential
	information about others, without explicit permission to do so. CUNY
	employees must take precautions to protect the confidentiality of personal or
	confidential information encountered in the performance of their duties or
	otherwise.
	
	<br>7. Integrity of Computer Resources. Users may not install, use or develop
	programs intended to infiltrate or damage a computer resource, or which could
	reasonably be expected to cause, directly or indirectly, excessive strain on any
	computing facility. This includes, but is not limited to, programs known as
	computer viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. Users should consult with the IT
	director at their college before installing any programs that they are not sure are
	safe.
	
	<br>8. Disruptive Activities. CUNY computer resources must not be used in a manner
	that could reasonably be expected to cause or does cause, directly or indirectly,
	unwarranted or unsolicited interference with the activity of other users. This
	provision explicitly prohibits chain letters, virus hoaxes or other intentional e-mail
	transmissions that disrupt normal e-mail service. Also prohibited are spamming,
	junk mail or other unsolicited mail that is not related to CUNY business and is
	sent without a reasonable expectation that the recipient would welcome receiving
	it, as well as the inclusion on e-mail lists of individuals who have not requested
	membership on the lists, other than the inclusion of members of the CUNY
	community on lists related to CUNY business. CUNY has the right to require
	users of CUNY computer resources to limit or refrain from other specific uses if,
	in the opinion of the IT director at the user&rsquo;s college, such use interferes with
	efficient operations of the system, subject to appeal to the President or, in the
	case of central office staff, to the Chancellor.
	
<br>	9. CUNY Names and Trademarks. CUNY names, trademarks and logos belong to
	the university and are protected by law. Users of CUNY computer resources
	may not state or imply that they speak on behalf of CUNY or use a CUNY name,
	trademark or logo without authorization to do so. Affiliation with CUNY does
	not, by itself, imply authorization to speak on behalf of CUNY.
	
	<br>10. Security. CUNY employs various measures to protect the security of its
	computer resources and of users&rsquo; accounts. However, CUNY cannot guarantee
	such security. Users are responsible for engaging in safe computing practices such
	as guarding and not sharing their passwords, changing passwords regularly, logging
	out of systems at the end of use, and protecting private information, as well as for
	following CUNY&rsquo;s Information Security policies and procedures. Users must
	report incidents of Information Security policy non-compliance or other security
	incidents to CUNY&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security
	Officer, and the IT director at the affected user&rsquo;s college.
	
	<br>11. Filtering. CUNY reserves the right to install spam, virus and spyware filters and
	similar devices if necessary in the judgment of CUNY&rsquo;s Office of Information
	Technology or a college IT director to protect the security and integrity of CUNY
	computer resources. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CUNY will not install filters
	that restrict access to e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms or websites based
	solely on content.
	
	<br>12. Confidential Research Information. Principal investigators and others who use
	CUNY computer resources to store or transmit research information that is
	required by law or regulation to be held confidential or for which a promise of
	confidentiality has been given, are responsible for taking steps to protect
	confidential research information from unauthorized access or modification. In
	general, this means storing the information on a computer that provides strong
	access controls (passwords) and encrypting files, documents, and messages for
	protection against inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure while in storage or in
	transit over data networks. Robust encryption is strongly recommended for
	information stored electronically on all computers, especially portable devices
	such as notebook computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and portable
	data storage (e.g., memory sticks) that are vulnerable to theft or loss, as well as
	for information transmitted over public networks. Software and protocols used
	should be reviewed and approved by CUNY&rsquo;s Office of Information Technology.
	
	<br>13. CUNY Access to Computer Resources.
	CUNY does not routinely monitor, inspect, or disclose individual usage of its
	computer resources without the user&rsquo;s consent. In most instances, if the
	university needs information located in a CUNY computer resource, it will simply
	request it from the author or custodian. However, CUNY IT professionals and
	staff do regularly monitor general usage patterns as part of normal system
	operations and maintenance and might, in connection with these duties, observe
	the contents of web sites, e-mail or other electronic communications. Except as
	provided in this policy or by law, these individuals are not permitted to seek out
	contents or transactional information, or disclose or otherwise use what they have
	observed. Nevertheless, because of the inherent vulnerability of computer
	technology to unauthorized intrusions, users have no guarantee of privacy during
	any use of CUNY computer resources or in any data in them, whether or not a
	password or other entry identification or encryption is used. Users may expect
	that the privacy of their electronic communications and of any materials contained
	in computer storage in any CUNY electronic device dedicated to their use will not
	be intruded upon by CUNY except as outlined in this policy.
	
	CUNY may specifically monitor or inspect the activity and accounts of individual
	users of CUNY computer resources, including individual login sessions, e-mail and
	other communications, without notice, in the following circumstances:
	
	a. when the user has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, as by
	posting to Usenet or a web page;
	b. when it is reasonably necessary to do so to protect the integrity, security,
	or functionality of CUNY or other computer resources, as determined by
	the college chief information officer or his or her designee, after
	consultation with CUNY&rsquo;s chief information officer or his or her designee;
	c. when it is reasonably necessary to diagnose and resolve technical problems
	involving system hardware, software, or communications, as determined
	by the college chief information officer or his or her designee, after
	consultation with CUNY&rsquo;s chief information officer or his or her designee;
	d. when it is reasonably necessary to protect CUNY from liability, or when
	failure to act might result in significant bodily harm, significant property
	loss or damage, or loss of significant evidence, as determined by the college
	president or a vice president designated by the president, after
	consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the Chair of the
	University Faculty Senate (if a CUNY faculty member&rsquo;s account or
	activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable;
	e. when there is a reasonable basis to believe that CUNY policy or federal,
	state or local law has been or is being violated, as determined by the college
	president or a vice president designated by the president, after
	consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the Chair of the
	University Faculty Senate (if a CUNY faculty member&rsquo;s account or
	activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable;
	f. when an account appears to be engaged in unusual or unusually excessive
	activity, as indicated by the monitoring of general activity and usage
	patterns, as determined by the college president or a vice president
	designated by the president and the college chief information officer or his
	or her designee, after consultation with CUNY&rsquo;s chief information officer
	or his or her designee, the Office of General Counsel, and the Chair of the
	University Faculty Senate (if a CUNY faculty member&rsquo;s account or
	activity is involved) or Vice Chair if the Chair is unavailable; or
	g. as otherwise required by law.
	
	In those situations in which the Chair of the University Faculty Senate is to be
	consulted prior to monitoring or inspecting an account or activity, the following
	procedures shall apply: (i) the college president shall report the completion of
	the monitoring or inspection to the Chair and the CUNY employee affected, who
	shall also be told the reason for the monitoring or inspection, except where
	specifically forbidden by law; and (ii) if the monitoring or inspection of an account
	or activity requires physical entry into a faculty member&rsquo;s office, the faculty
	member shall be advised prior thereto and shall be permitted to be present to
	observe, except where specifically forbidden by law.
	
	A CUNY employee may apply to the General Counsel for an exemption from
	some or all of the circumstances under which CUNY may inspect and monitor
	computer resource activity and accounts, pursuant to subparagraphs (a)-(f) above,
	with respect to a CUNY computer resource used solely for the collection,
	examination, analysis, transmission or storage of confidential research data. In
	considering such application, the General Counsel shall have the right to require
	the employee to affirm in writing that the computer resource will be used solely
	for the confidential research. Any application for exemption should be made
	prior to using the computer resource for the confidential research.
	
	CUNY, in its discretion, may disclose the results of any general or individual
	monitoring or inspection to appropriate CUNY personnel or agents, or law
	enforcement or other agencies. The results may be used in college disciplinary
	proceedings, discovery proceedings in legal actions, or otherwise as is necessary to
	protect the interests of the University.
	
	In addition, users should be aware that CUNY may be required to disclose to the
	public under the New York State Freedom of Information Law communications
	made by means of CUNY computer resources in conjunction with University
	business.
	
	Any disclosures of activity of accounts of individual users to persons or entities
	outside of CUNY, whether discretionary or required by law, shall be approved by
	the General Counsel and shall be conducted in accordance with any applicable law.
	Except where specifically forbidden by law, CUNY employees subject to such
	disclosures shall be informed promptly after the disclosure of the actions taken
	and the reasons for them.
	
	The Office of General Counsel shall issue an annual statement of the instances of
	account monitoring or inspection that fall within categories (d) through (g) above.
	The statement shall indicate the number of such instances and the cause and result
	of each. No personally identifiable data shall be included in this statement.
	See CUNY&rsquo;s Web Site Privacy Policy for additional information regarding data
	collected by CUNY from visitors to the CUNY website at www.cuny.edu.
	<br>14. Enforcement. Violation of this policy may result in suspension or termination of
	an individual&rsquo;s right of access to CUNY computer resources, disciplinary action
	by appropriate CUNY authorities, referral to law enforcement authorities for
	criminal prosecution, or other legal action, including action to recover civil damages
	and penalties.
	
	Violations will normally be handled through the university disciplinary procedures
	applicable to the relevant user. For example, alleged violations by students will
	normally be investigated, and any penalties or other discipline will normally be
	imposed, by the Office of Student Affairs.
	
	CUNY has the right to temporarily suspend computer use privileges and to
	remove from CUNY computer resources material it believes violates this policy,
	pending the outcome of an investigation of misuse or finding of violation. This
	power may be exercised only by the President of each college or the Chancellor.
	
	15. Additional Rules. Additional rules, policies, guidelines and/or restrictions may
	be in effect for specific computers, systems, or networks, or at specific computer
	facilities at the discretion of the directors of those facilities. Any such rules which
	potentially limit the privacy or confidentiality of electronic communications or
	information contained in or delivered by or over CUNY computer resources will
	be subject to the substantive and procedural safeguards provided by this policy.
	
	16. Disclaimer. CUNY shall not be responsible for any damages, costs or other
	liabilities of any nature whatsoever with regard to the use of CUNY computer
	resources. This includes, but is not limited to, damages caused by unauthorized
	access to CUNY computer resources, data loss, or other damages resulting from
	delays, non-deliveries, or service interruptions, whether or not resulting from
	circumstances under the CUNY&rsquo;s control.
	
	Users receive and use information obtained through CUNY computer resources at
	their own risk. CUNY makes no warranties (expressed or implied) with respect to
	the use of CUNY computer resources. CUNY accepts no responsibility for the
	content of web pages or graphics that are linked from CUNY web pages, for any
	advice or information received by a user through use of CUNY computer
	resources, or for any costs or charges incurred by a user as a result of seeking or
	accepting such advice or information.
	
	CUNY reserves the right to change this policy and other related policies at any
	time. CUNY reserves any rights and remedies that it may have under any
	applicable law, rule or regulation. Nothing contained in this policy will in any
	way act as a waiver of such rights and remedies.
