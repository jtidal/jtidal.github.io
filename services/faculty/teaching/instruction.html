  <p style="text-align: justify;">The Ursula C. Schwerin Library's information literacy and instruction program, in collaboration with faculty across the college, teaches students how to find, evaluate, and ethically use information. The program aims to ensure students’ academic success and prepare them for lifelong learning. Classroom instructors must attend the session with their classes and stay through the entire session.</p>
