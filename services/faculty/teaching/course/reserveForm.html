<p>Please note that it is usually not possible for libraries to purchase ebook versions of textbooks because publishers do not typically offer ebook licenses for textbooks. (To learn more, <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/library/statement-on-textbooks-in-the-library-collection-92.htm" style="text-decoration:underline;">Librarians at Grand Valley State University have written a terrific explainer</a>).</p>
<p>You are welcome to submit reserve requests for etextbooks for your courses, though note that unfortunately many publishers do not offer ebook/etextbook licenses for libraries, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pearson</li>
<li>Cengage</li>
<li>McGraw Hill</li>
<li>Oxford University Press</li>
<li>Most publishers of popular fiction and nonfiction</li>
<li>Many health sciences texts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Check the Libraryâ€™s <a href="https://cuny-ny.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01CUNY_NY:CUNY_NY" style="text-decoration:underline;">catalog</a> to determine whether the Library owns a copy of the title you are requesting.</li>
<li>Please submit your request as soon as possible, but a minimum of two weeks is required to allow for processing.</li>
<li>It will take considerably longer if the Library does not already own the material.</li>
<li>The Library cannot purchase all requested materials due to budgetary constraints, but will make its best efforts to fulfill requests.</li>
<li>The Library does not purchase copies of textbooks that are available online for students to download for free, such as OpenStax or other OER books (note that students are able to print for free in the Library, iTEC, and Learning Center computer labs).</li>
<li>Materials are removed from reserve at the end of each semester unless you indicate otherwise (Please indicate if you are donating the books to the library or not).</li>
<li>Instructors are responsible for retrieving personal materials no longer on reserve.</li>
<li>Where materials do not fall within Fair Use, they may still be placed on reserve provided the faculty member has received permission from the copyright holder.</li>
<li>If permission has not been secured, consult the <a href="https://guides.cuny.edu/cunyfairuse/faculty"  style="text-decoration:underline;">Faculty &amp; Staff: Fair Use and Copyright - Teaching</a> for guidance.</li>
<li>Seeking and obtaining permissions may entail significant costs in fees and take considerable time. These costs must be covered by the faculty member.</li>
<li>The City Tech library may limit the number of photocopied items on reserve based on copyright constraints, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research." If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.</p>
