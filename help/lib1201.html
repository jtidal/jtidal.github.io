<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>
<p>This special topics course offers an interdisciplinary approach to investigating our built environment using a case study focused on a specific place each semester. This course combines physical examination with information research and data collection using methodologies developed in multiple disciplines. Students from a variety of departments engage in on-site exploration and in-depth research of a location in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Course Structure:</strong></p>
<p>This course combines a series of research seminars with field work, site visits and documentation, and on and off campus research. Combinations of individual and team assignments as well as class participation are the basis for the final grade. The culmination of the weekly assignments is the Final Report as well as a Wikipedia Entry or Existing Site Editing. The Final Report will be published on the Open Lab and accessible to the entire City Tech community.</p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong> Final grade will be determined according to the following grade weighting:</p>
<p>50% Site Documentation Reports<br> 10% Annotated Bibliography<br> 15% Team Research Assignment<br> 20% Final Report Assignment <br> 5% Class Participation</p>
