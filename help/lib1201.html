    <p>In this course we will explore issues in research and documentation for text (in print and online), images, sound, and multimedia. You will investigate where information comes from and how it is organized in both traditional and emerging media. We will examine the ethics of information use and determine how to critically evaluate sources. Throughout the course, you will create and present research and documentation projects using traditional and emerging media and technologies.<br> <br>The course satisfies the Individual &amp; Society requirement (or may be taken to satisfy Core requirements in Communications [COMM] or as an Elective [ELECT]).</p>
