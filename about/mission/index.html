Schwerin Library at New York City College of Technology is integral to the educational mission of the college, and fosters connections with and supports students, faculty, and staff in their academic pursuits. Library faculty and staff are committed to student success as we implement and acquire those services and resources that will have the greatest positive impact on the diverse City Tech community. The library offers physical and online access to academic resources, information technology, and study space. Our collections provide our students with opportunities for intellectual exploration, and library faculty empower students to find and critically evaluate information and its uses. As members of an academic department in the college, library faculty research, innovate, and lead on issues in library and information studies, scholarly communications, instructional technology, pedagogy, and higher education.</p>

<h2>A History of the City Tech Library</h2>
<h3>By Eustace O. Burnett</h3>
<p>Pearl Street, Franklin, Namm, Concord, Livingston, Voorhees, Jay Street. There were the libraries of City Tech. They are all gone now but from the many has come one - the Atrium Library.</p>

<h3>Pearl Building</h3>
<p>The first library was set up in the Pearl Building. It was the only building on campus and the official address was 300 Pearl Street. Nobody seems to remember when the library was opened - best guess is late forties or early fifties - but they do recall that it was, in many ways, a microcosm of the college; that is, much of the furnishings and even its book collection came from the surplus of city and other government agencies. In an allotted space, the equivalent of five classrooms spread out under a ceiling crisscrossed with naked plumbing, it was a cramped operation outdated before its first day of service. The library, although important to the college, was not a top priority. After the initial set-up exercise it suffered several years of benign neglect. An unfavorable report from Middle States brought the library's condition to the administration's attention and, in 1957, Leonard Cohan was appointed chief librarian with the view of setting things right.</p>

<p>Library progress in 1961 was marked by a professional faculty of three very versatile librarians. The Chief, in addition to his administrative tasks, was his own acquisitions person and took turns at reference as necessary. The cataloger was also a reference person and assisted at circulation if needed.</p><p>The reference librarian worked circulation too. There was a department secretary who was also acquisitions typist and a C.O.A. equivalent who did technical processing.</p><p>The book collection had, at most, 10,000 volumes complemented by about forty periodical titles. Seating was still a shoehorn affair but the place was busy serving the college community sixty hours per week.</p>

<p>That year was one of optimism for the college and particularly for the library. Klitgord Center was brand new and the new academic building (Namm Hall), which included a library, was on the drawing board.</p>

<h3>Franklin</h3>

<p>The Pearl building was filled quickly. To ease the overcrowding, the college acquired from the War Assets Administration the building at Franklin and Flushing Avenues, officially 12 Franklin Avenue. There was a persistent but unsubstantiated rumor that this had been a navy coffin factory. It was not, but it added to the mystique of the place.</p><p>Graphic arts, commercial art and marketing were in "Franklin Hall", and being quite a distance from the main campus it also had a library. There was no telephone service, no student assistants in the first three years, and the nearest phone was in the downstairs office. There was not much room in between; either one liked Franklin or hated it. Whatever opinion one had it was a very interesting place to work and study.</p><p>The surrounding area had a high concentration of commercial and industrial establishments accompanied by the comings and going of fleets of eighteen-wheelers. In close proximity was a chocolatier and a perfumery whose cloying scents assailed the nose ad nauseam while feathers flowing from the nearby live chicken market, caught in unexpected updrafts, provided "snow" year-round. Across the street was a large laundry with what seemed to be the world's loudest public address system which summoned Harry all day. "Harry, Harry, Telephone!" still echoes in the ears. Soot and grit were in abundance. Transportation to the main campus was by bus, by foot (quite a walk) or, if one wanted a "view", the Myrtle Avenue E1 (anyone remember that one?).</p><p>The library with its eight or nine hundred volumes and dozen periodical subscriptions had windows on both avenues and was a receptacle for the exhaust of every motor vehicle passing the busy intersection. It seated twenty and was open sixty hours per week. Circulation was not great for home use but "in house" use of materials was substantial.</p>

<h3>Namm</h3>
<p>Namm library opened in 1967. Edward Mapp, who succeeded Leonard Cohan in 1964, was chief librarian. Librarians hailed the new addition. After all it was the college's first planned library. There was new furniture and equipment and the budget afforded expansion of book and periodical collections. There was an audiovisual department, a periodicals room and a reference room. Compared to the defunct Pearl library this was a huge establishment. The chief librarian initiated the first library based bibliographic instruction program. To keep pace with an increasing work load the number of librarians went from four to fourteen. Here the book collection reached the 100,000 volume mark. All was not well however. From the beginning it was obvious that the library was too small and Mapp was always on the lookout for space. Eventually the overcrowding was eased by moving technical services into the space where the mailroom stands now and later yet librarians shared desk space in the room with the telephone operators.</p><p>Another major problem was the placement of the library. It was in the basement, directly under the cafeteria. The location created ventilation problems from the beginning and proximity to the cafeteria brought its own unique problem. Whenever the floors upstairs were washed the water came flowing down to drench some unsuspecting scholar and ruin books and furniture. For variation the water was sometimes replaced with a gooey substance of undetermined composition. This problem defied all solutions and lasted as long as the library did.</p>

<p>The main steam conduit for the building passed through the reference room. This provided a year round sauna. After much begging, pleading, threatening and cajoling the administration was persuaded to provide year round air conditioning.</p>

<p>This solution brought its own problems. Condensation cascaded down the walls. Bugs liked both the warmth of the conduit and the dampness from the condensation, not to mention the paper and glue of the books. Under these happy (for them) circumstances they moved into the reference room in large numbers and enjoyed the facilities immensely.</p><p>Namm library lasted twenty years. In 1985 work was started on the Atrium library. Much of the early construction was done in the Namm library while classes where in session. The steel girders were put in while students were at their books and jack hammers and pile drivers made noisy accompaniment to study. Bathrooms in use at the beginning of the hour vanished before the quarter chimed.</p>

<p>As the building progressed more library space vanished and it became increasingly compressed. At last the much maligned main steam conduit was dismantled but not before winter came. That meant no heat. Students, librarians and staff stuck it out. Then when it was thought that the worst had passed the entire west wall of the library was torn down and a tarpaulin was hung to shelter the inhabitants from the winter cold. It was the most difficult of times for librarians, staff, and students but almost two years later all were delivered from the nightmare of the Namm library and removed to the Atrium.</p>

<h3>Concord</h3>
<p>Some time in the mid 1960's the college leased space in a building near the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge. The area is rarely without heavy traffic, making the trip across the street on the way to the main campus a hazardous undertaking. The faculty of the engineering technology department used this as a pretext for having a library in the building. A branch was opened, part-time, in 1965, with a very small reference collection. It closed in 1967.</p>

<h3>Livingston</h3>
<p>In 1966 the university opened the College Center at 250 Livingston Street. It was a self-contained unit, occupying the entire sixth floor, intended to provide students with the freshman year of study. The space was renovated to university specifications and all furniture and equipment were new. The library also had a new book collection, purchased preprocessed and ready to be put on the shelves.</p><p>Most of the administrators and staff, including the librarian, were on loan from New York City Community College, which was responsible for oversight of the project. The library, an airy well-lighted facility, seated fifty readers and offered traditional services. At the end of the academic year the program was ended and that annex became a part of New York City Community College. Graphic arts, marketing and accounting were transferred there along with the books used by those departments. Livingston was closed in 1975 and its collections moved to Namm library. The furnishings were used in the Jay Street library.</p>

<h3>Voorhees</h3>
<p>New York City Community College and Voorhees Technical Institute, an old (1880) institution in the field of technical education, became one in 1971. A self-contained campus, housed in its own building at West 41st Street, Voorhees brought a library, the source of constant headache.</p>
<p>Located in a windowless suite of rooms, wedged in between Machine Tool and Welding, library ventilation was piped in from a roof unit. Unfortunately the intake mechanism brought in the exhaust gases from the many idling diesels at nearby Port Authority Bus Terminal. Day's end was usually Bayer time. The library needed much more attention than the other branch, livingston, currently on line. The collection was in serious decline and there was a need for clerical and professional personnel. It was also the period when the university was changing from the Dewey to the Library of Congress Classification scheme. In a relatively short period many new books were added and the collection was rebuilt largely as a closed collection. Library faculty member, Prof. Morris Hounion, was the specialist who did the reclassification. In time the ventilation problem was solved, materials were made current and the library became a strong link in the New York City Community College branch library chain. With the coming of the Atrium library Voorhees was closed.</p>

<h3>Jay Street</h3><p>In 1975 the decision was made to abandon the Livingston property. By then the Jay Street building was opened and some of the furniture from Livingston was used in the Jay Street branch library. It was smaller than Livingston but it was a very good facility. The collection was made up, for the most part, of books on engineering technology. Unlike students at other branches which had been more distant from the main campus Jay Street students could depend on the Namm Library for materials they might need in other disciplines.</p><p>The plan worked well enough but a single library has always been the goal and the plan of the Atrium Library made this a certainty. Work began on the latter in 1985 and on its completion two years later the Jay Street library branch went out of existence and the building was renamed Voorhees.</p>

<h3>Library Building</h3>
<p>In 2018, the Atrium was renamed the Library Building.</p>
