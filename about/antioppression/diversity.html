title: City Tech Library Statement on Diversity and Inclusion
---

<p>The City Tech Library upholds the fundamental values of respect, intellectual freedom, equal access to knowledge, and service to all members of the CUNY community.</p>
<p>We promote equal and fair treatment for everyone, regardless of ethnicity, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, ability, political viewpoint, socioeconomic background, religion, country of origin, veteran/military service status, or citizenship/immigration status.</p>
<p>Supporting and embracing diversity and inclusion is central to our mission, and core to our professional ethos and democracy as expressed in the <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill" style="text-decoration: underline;">American Library Association Library Bill of Rights</a>. We embody, defend, and advance these shared values in our own practices.</p>
<p>We accomplish this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respectfully supporting CUNY students, faculty, and staff</li>
<li>Empowering our communities to critically evaluate and apply information based on the tenets of information literacy</li>
<li>Protecting patron privacy</li>
<li>Providing a forum for civil discourse, exchange of ideas, learning, and empowerment</li>
</ul>
<p>CUNY Libraries have long advocated for the success and empowerment of our communities, and we are committed to supporting CUNYâ€™s <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/about/history/" style="text-decoration: underline;">mission</a> in these challenging times.</p>
<p>Affirmed by City Tech Library faculty and staff, February 3, 2017</p>
