<p>New York City (Lenapehoking) is built on unceded land of the Lenape people–past, present, and future. New York City College of Technology is among the thousands of institutions and businesses in this city that were founded upon exclusions and erasures of indigenous people, including the Lenape who were displaced from this land. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the legacies of settler colonialism.* </p>

<p>The City Tech Library is engaged in the following practices as part of this commitment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designating 5% of collection budgets to purchase materials about indigenous history, written by indigenous authors, and published by indigenous presses
<li>Incorporating indigenous history into library credit course curricula
<li>Highlighting the underrepresentation of indigenous struggles in media as part of library information literacy instruction
<li>Compiling resources for patrons that highlight historic and contemporary struggles for indigenous sovereignty and acknowledge the legacy of colonial violence as it is manifested in institutional settings
</ul>
