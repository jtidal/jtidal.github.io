  <p>Library faculty are available to provide research and information literacy instruction for your courses. We offer <a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/help/ask/index.html">24/7 online reference service</a> available to students and faculty who have questions about library resources and services, how to find articles, books, and media, help with citation styles, and more!</p>
  <p>Have a research assignment in your class, and want your students to consult a librarian?</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/research/subjectSpecialists.php">Contact the library subject specialist</a> in your discipline or program.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/services/faculty/teaching/request.html">Request a library instruction session</a> for your class.</li>
    <li><a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/help/ask/index.html">Refer your students to our Ask a Librarian 24/7 chat reference service</a> for assistance with their research assignments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Through our chat service, students can get the same level of one-on-one support as they would during a in-person research consultation. Students and librarians can, if desired, screenshare with each other.</p>
  <p>Please note that, due to personnel constraints, we are unable to schedule one-on-one consultations for every student in a class. Requesting instruction or referring students to Ask a Librarian chat reference is the best way for library faculty to support your students in their research assignments.</p>

  <h2>Policies for Recording Online Library Instruction</h2>
  <p>Concerns about library instruction sessions being recorded without consent from library faculty, and lack of clarity around where and for how long recordings will be stored, especially in sessions taught by adjunct faculty, have prompted these best practices for recording library instruction sessions:</p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Before recording, faculty who request library instruction in their classes must obtain consent in advance from the library faculty member teaching the session. Library faculty members may ask you to stop recording before beginning to teach the session.</strong></li>


    <li>Faculty should be prepared to tell library faculty where the session recording will be hosted, who will have access to it, and how long the recording will be kept, or allow library faculty to maintain control of and provide access to recordings.</li>

    <li>If library faculty do not wish the session to be recorded, we can provide asynchronous resources for your students covering similar content.</li>
  </ul>
