<h2>Eligibility:</h2>
<p>Any City Tech library user with a valid ID card is entitled to have a yellow title METRO Card issued to him or her. METRO referral cards provide library users with access to a specific item that is not available at the City Tech library, within the holdings of CUNY, at an ALB (Academic Libraries of Brooklyn) member library, or at a public library in New York City. If the user is able to verify that a particular title is available only at a METRO member library, then the card request should be honored. <a  href="http://metro.org/referral-cards/">Verification guidelines</a> are detailed on the METRO website. City Tech library provides yellow title METRO cards for consultation of a specific title on-site; no borrowing privileges are included. City Tech neither accepts nor issues blue subject referral METRO cards.</p>

<h2>Issuing a METRO card:</h2> Librarians at the reference desk should exercise their best judgment when determining the eligibility of a pass request. In order to preserve the good institutional relationships that enable the METRO referral system to work well, librarians should call the reference desk of the holding library on behalf of the user, check the METRO website for any restrictions imposed by the holding library, and fill out all of the fields on the METRO card. Librarians issuing METRO cards should make a photocopy of the front of the card and turn it in to the resource sharing coordinator.</p>

<h2>Visiting a METRO library:</h2> When the card is issued, the librarian should inform the library user that the card is good for one visit only. The librarian should telephone the holding library to confirm library hours and ownership of the item, as well as to find out about any access restrictions. The METRO title referral card (yellow card) does not entitle users to reference assistance or borrowing rights, nor does it guarantee that the material required will be available during the time of the visit. METRO card users should familiarize themselves with the regulations printed on the back of the card ("to the user") before they visit the METRO member library.</p>
