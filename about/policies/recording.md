Policies for Recording Online Library Instruction

Concerns about library instruction sessions being recorded without consent from library faculty, and lack of clarity around where and for how long recordings will be stored, especially in sessions taught by adjunct faculty, have prompted these best practices for recording library instruction sessions:

    Before recording, faculty who request library instruction in their classes must obtain consent in advance from the library faculty member teaching the session. Library faculty members may ask you to stop recording before beginning to teach the session.
    Faculty should be prepared to tell library faculty where the session recording will be hosted, who will have access to it, and how long the recording will be kept, or allow library faculty to maintain control of and provide access to recordings.
    If library faculty do not wish the session to be recorded, we can provide asynchronous resources for your students covering similar content.
