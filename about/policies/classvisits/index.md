<h2>By Appointment Only, Please</h2>
<p>We welcome faculty to bring their classes to the library for research and information literacy instruction! City Tech library faculty offer classes, workshops, and customized instruction for assignments and courses in all departments and disciplines at the college. Additionally, instructors may reserve the library's electronic classroom for use with their classes when the room is available.</p>
<p>With the library's space constraints we unfortunately <strong>cannot</strong> accommodate an entire class of students on an unscheduled drop-in basis, nor can librarians at the Reference Desk provide ad hoc instruction or Reference service for an entire class. Should you wish to bring your students for a library visit, please contact <a href="mailto:aleonard@citytech.cuny.edu">Anne Leonard</a><a href="mailto:aleonard@citytech.cuny.edu">,</a> Information Literacy Librarian, to make an appointment.</p>
