<h2>Primary Function of the Collection</strong></h2>
<p>The collections serve City Tech students through the provision of reference, circulating, and electronic library materials which support and supplement the college curriculum in all its disciplines, course offerings, and curriculum-related independent study.&nbsp; Emphasis is placed on those materials which relate directly to the career aspirations of our students, and provide for cultural enrichment, social inquiry, and general education.&nbsp; The diversity of our students' backgrounds is reflected in the library collections.</p>
<p>Textbooks that students are required to purchase or rent for their courses are acquired for reserve (as funding permits) only to provide back-up support. The reserve collection is not intended as an alternative to purchasing or renting required materials. The library will purchase some required texts that serve the curricular or research needs of our users, but cannot commit to purchasing copies of all required texts, much less multiple copies of any title.&nbsp; Items such as study guides and workbooks will not be purchased by the library. When a book is no longer required by an instructor, or if no instructor requests to have that title placed on reserve, it will be removed from reserve and its status reassessed.</p>
<p>The collections also serve college faculty and administrators with materials useful in higher education program planning, curriculum development, management, classroom teaching, information and educational technologies, and resources about college students.&nbsp; Interlibrary loan and networking arrangements with other libraries are available for research needs.</p>
<p>Since the library does not collect at the research level, faculty are encouraged to use other institutions within CUNY, <a href="https://jtidal.github.io/research/otherLibraries/index.html">Academic Libraries of Brooklyn (ALB), and METRO</a> or <a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/services/faculty/ill/index.html">interlibrary loan</a>.</p>
