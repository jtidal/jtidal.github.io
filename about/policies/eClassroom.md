 <p>City Tech librarians use the library classroom, L540, to teach over 350 library research and information literacy classes per year. L540 is the libraryâ€™s main teaching space, with capacity for 30 students at PC workstations, an instructor PC, two projectors, and two screens. There is a black and white laser printer and a dry-erase board. The library welcomes requests from faculty from other departments interested in making use of the active learning capabilities of L540. To make access as equitable as possible, we want faculty to be familiar with our policies for using L540 without a librarian:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requests are considered on a case-by-case basis</li> 
<li>L540 bookings are limited to the class meeting time</li>  
<li>Weekend and evening hours are sometimes available</li> 
<li>L540 is unavailable when the library is closed</li> 
<li>Drinks and food are not allowed in the library</li> 
<li>Classes must leave the room as they found it, and instructors must remain with their students</li> 
</ul>

<p>Please know that scheduling <a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/services/faculty/teaching/request.html">library instruction sessions</a> takes priority throughout the year. To request use of L540, please email <a href="mailto:aleonard@citytech.cuny.edu">Prof. Anne Leonard</a> one week in advance of your desired date. There is usually more flexibility and availability at these times:</p>

<ul>
<li>After November Break</li>
<li>After Spring Break</li>
<li>Most Fridays</li> 
<li>Summer and January sessions</li> 
</ul>

<p>Tech support is generally available weekdays (9-5) during Fall and Spring semesters. We have limited ability to provide tech support at other times.</p>
<p>Class visits to the library are by appointment only. Read our complete <a href="https://library.citytech.cuny.edu/about/policies/classvisits/index.html">class visits policy</a>.</p>
