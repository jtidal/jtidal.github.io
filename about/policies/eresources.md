<p>The electronic resources provided by the Ursula C. Schwerin Library are governed by legally binding license agreements, negotiated between the library and the publishers. These licenses allow students, faculty, staff, and other authorized users to access the resources for non-commercial, educational and scholarly purposes. Off-campus use requires confirmation of affiliation with City Tech.</p>
<p>Users of library-licensed resources must comply with U.S. Copyright Law (including the protections of Fair use) and licensing agreements of the publishers. Breach of license may lead a publisher/vendor to terminate the College's access.</p>
<h2>EXPRESSELY PROHIBITED:</h2>
<p>Use of any software designed to automatically browse the web ("robots", "spiders", "crawlers", etc.), record web browsing activity, or systematically download content for offline use is expressly forbidden and jeopardizes the entire College's access to that resource.</p>
<p>Violators may face disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Examples of prohibited activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading all articles in a journal issue;</li>
<li>Downloading articles from most issues of a journal;</li>
<li>Sizable downloads of database reports;</li>
<li>Sharing usernames and passwords;</li>
<li>Posting copyrighted materials on publicly accessible websites;</li>
<li>Using electronic resources for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
