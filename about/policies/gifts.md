<p>The library encourages gifts of library materials which meet the library's collection development criteria with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All materials should be in good physical condition.</li>
<li>Only current editions (latest and one previous edition) of textbooks are welcome.</li>
<li>All donations of more than 5 items must be reviewed before acceptance.</li>
<li>Gifts are accepted with the understanding that upon receipt by the library they belong to the library and will be retained or otherwise disposed of at the library's discretion without further obligation to the donor.</li>
<li>The physical location of materials, related circulation policies, cataloging procedures, etc. are determined by the library department.</li>
<li>Publicity or publications (including in-house publications) pertaining to gifts or a gift collection are produced in consultation with the library department. The library can make no commitment to update particular gift collections in future years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The library does not accept gifts of periodicals.</p>
<p>For DVDs, CDs, and other media formats, please consult with <a href="mailto:jtidal@citytech.cuny.edu">Prof. Junior Tidal</a> <br><br> Upon request, the library prepares gift receipt acknowledgements.&nbsp;For tax deduction purposes, we cannot provide an assessed value for donated materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gift books not retained for the libraryâ€™s collection are often kept aside for the library's book sales or distributed free to the college community.</p>
