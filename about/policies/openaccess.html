title: City Tech Library Faculty: Statement on Open Access
---
<p>The City Tech library faculty believe that open access to scholarship is critical for scholarly communication and for the future of libraries. For that reason we pledge to make our own research freely available whenever possible by seeking publishers that have either adopted open access policies, publish contents online without restriction, and/or allow authors to <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/">self-archive</a> their publications on the web. We pledge to link to and/or self-archive our publications to make them freely accessible.</p>

<p>Faculty librarians may submit their work to a publication that does not follow open access principles and will not allow self archiving only if it is clearly the best or only option for publication; however, library faculty will actively seek out publishers that allow them to make their research available freely online and, when necessary, will negotiate with publishers to improve publication agreements. Further, we pledge to devote most of our reviewing and editing efforts to manuscripts destined for open access.</p>
