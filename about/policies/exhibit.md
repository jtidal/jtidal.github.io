<ol>
  <li>Library exhibits showcase educational, artistic, cultural, and informational materials for the City Tech community--our students, faculty, and staff. These exhibits support the educational mission of the college and the university by highlighting local scholarship and items of interest to the college community.</li><br />
  <li>Factors to be considered include suitability for a college audience, educational value, thematic coherence and aesthetic appeal.</li><br />
  <li>Exhibit applications may come from departments, groups and individual members of the City Tech community. Groups or individuals not affiliated with City Tech may apply to use the exhibit space with a sponsor from within the college community. If a proposed exhibit has outstanding merit, the CLE may choose to act as that sponsor.</li><br />
  <li>Applications &nbsp;for the use of library exhibit space for the purpose of sponsoring displays must reach the Committee on Library Exhibits (CLE) a semester prior to the proposed exhibit dates. Length of the exhibit will be determined along with the CLE. </li><br />
  <li>Exhibitors are responsible for assembling exhibit materials and for installing and removing their own exhibit from the cases (including any cleanup necessary) in a timely manner, a schedule for which will be determined with the CLE at the time of approval. The library does not provide long-term storage for exhibit contents.</li><br />
  <li>Explanatory text and clear labels must accompany exhibit materials and will be approved by the CLE prior to installation.</li><br />
  <li>The library department is a co-sponsor of all exhibits and, as such, assumes the final authority over displays. The library will not approve exhibits that focus exclusively on one side of a controversial issue or exhibits designed for commercial gain.</li><br />
