<h2>What Is Interlibrary Loan?</h2>
<p>Interlibrary Loan (ILL) allows City Tech students, faculty, staff and administrators to borrow books, articles and other items that are not available in the Ursula C. Schwerin Library on campus.</p>
<p>For videos or other multimedia, please call the Multimedia Resources center at (718) 260-5476 or stop by the Multimedia Resources center office in L431.<a name="how"></a></p>
<h2>How Do I Use Interlibrary Loan?</h2>
<p>Request a book or article by logging into&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://citytech.ezproxy.cuny.edu/login?url=https://citytech-cuny.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll" target="_blank">ILLiad</a>; first-time users should create an&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://citytech.ezproxy.cuny.edu/login?url=https://citytech-cuny.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll" target="_blank">ILLiad account</a>.</p>
<p>Library users must create an ILLiad account to place ILL requests. Check <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/search?vid=ny&amp;lang=en_US">CUNY OneSearch</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://sfx.cuny.edu:9003/sfx_local-NY/journalsearch/nycct" target="_blank">full text e-journals</a> to be sure that City Tech does not already own the item you want.</p>
<p>Include as much information as possible about the book or article you need, including the ISSN or ISBN, edition, format, language. Library users should resolve any blocks on their library accounts before using ILL.</p>
<p>Many libraries do not lend multimedia or reference books through interlibrary loan.</p>

<h2>When Will The Item I Requested Be Available? How Long Can I Keep It?</h2>
<p>Books are typically available to pick up in 7-14 days. Articles are typically available to download in 1-7 days. However, please keep in mind that waiting times vary for each individual request. You can track your requests by logging on to your ILLiad account.</p>
<p>The library that lends the item determines the borrowing period; renewals may be requested in ILLiad from the Transaction Information page.<a name="contact"></a></p>

<h2>Interlibrary Loan Privacy Practice and Policies</h2>
<div style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="color: black;">Starting after the end of semester Fall 2020, we will begin regularly deleting past interlibrary loan requests. This is an effort to greater protect your privacy and </span>align <span style="color: black;">with other privacy policies in the library. We will delete requests twice a year, once in January following the fall semester and once in June following the spring semester. At that time, we will keep only open requests as well as any requests from the past 30 days so that you can continue to download any electronically received articles.</span> E<span style="color: black;">lectronically received articles will still continue to expire after 30 days.</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="color: black;">For the first round, we will delete past requests in January 2021, so please save any citations or information that you need to from your requests before that time. (If you’re not already using a citation manager, might we recommend <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://zotero.org">Zotero</a>).</span></div>
<div style="margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 14pt;"><span style="color: black;">We also delete student ILL accounts if the account has been inactive for 3 years or more, and we delete faculty &amp; staff ILL accounts if they have been inactive for 5 years or more. If your account has been deleted due to inactivity but you wish to place an ILL request, you can create a new account by <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://citytech-cuny.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll?Action=10&amp;Form=79" target="_blank">registering</a>.</span></div>
<h2>Information For Other Libraries</h2>
<p>City Tech loans most books for twelve weeks with two renewals. We charge what you charge for loans or photocopies; otherwise we lend free. We do not loan reference books, bound periodicals, multimedia, or items from course reserves. We participate in the METRO free interchange of photocopy program. Please send requests via OCLC ILL Web or ILLiad.</p>
