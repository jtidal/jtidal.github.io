<p>The City Tech Library seeks to provide a facility suitable for reading, learning, and other activities associated with 
scholarly teaching and research by creating a safe, welcoming environment where diverse experiences and perspectives are honored.</p>

<p>Permission must be requested in writing at least one week in advance from the Chief Librarian for filming or photography in public library spaces as part of 
any formal project, outreach initiative, or assignment. </p>

<p>Permission is not required for non-disruptive photography or filming for personal use (e.g. a selfie). The photographer is responsible for protecting 
others' reasonable expectations of privacy. This includes assuring that other people’s faces aren’t identifiable.</p>

<p>Patrons may be asked to discontinue photography or filming if a staff member of the library determines it is unsafe, inappropriate, or disruptive to students, faculty or staff.</p>

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:jtidal@citytech.cuny.edu">Prof. Junior Tidal</a>, Chief Librarian, for photography and filming inquiries.</p>
